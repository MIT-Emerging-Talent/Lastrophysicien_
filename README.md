# My Journey

My name is Cliforde, and I am a passionate dentist with a deep-rooted
fascination for science and technology. Since childhood, I have been
inspired by astronomy, physics, and data science. Alongside my dental
practice, I have devoted myself to mastering machine learning, driven by
an insatiable curiosity and desire to expand my skill set.

Picture a dentist who dedicates his nights to unraveling the secrets of
the universe and the intricacies of data science algorithms. Thatâ€™s who I
strive to be. Growing up in a low-income neighborhood in Port-au-Prince,
education was a cornerstone of my family values. My early exposure to
science through documentaries and scarce books sparked a lasting interest
in the field.

I pursued my dream at the Faculty of Dental
Medicine. Since earning my degree, I have worked relentlessly to enhance
oral health, particularly in underserved rural communities. My interests
span good music, caring for my family, and nurturing my love for pets.

Enrolling in this program is a pivotal step toward fulfilling my
aspiration to become a data scientist. It will allow me to blend my dental
expertise with advanced data-driven solutions for better community health.
